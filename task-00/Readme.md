## Why Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system that offers numerous advantages for developers, learners, and tech enthusiasts:

- **Open Source**: Linux's source code is accessible to everyone, ensuring transparency and allowing for a large community to provide support. Its open-source nature also makes it more secure compared to closed-source operating systems.
- **Ease of Development**: Linux enhances programming and development workflows with its robust tools and developer-friendly environment.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Using Linux provides a deeper understanding of operating systems, offering a valuable learning experience about how they function under the hood.
