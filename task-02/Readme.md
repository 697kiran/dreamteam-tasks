# Open Source Conventions & Google Dorking

## Overview

In this task, we explore the key conventions used in open-source projects, including coding styles, documentation standards, contribution guidelines, licensing, and community engagement. We also delve into the technique of **Google Dorking**, which uses advanced Google search operators to find specific information online.

The following objectives are covered:

- Understanding different open-source licenses (MIT, GPL, Apache, etc.) and when to use each one.
- Exploring typical contribution workflows, such as forking, pull requests, and code reviews.
- Analyzing a well-known open-source project and evaluating its contribution guidelines, license, documentation structure, and community engagement.
- Learning about Google Dorking through the TryHackMe platform, including its applications and ethical considerations.

## Objectives

1. **Open Source Licenses**: Gain an understanding of different licenses like MIT, GPL, Apache, and their appropriate use cases.
2. **Contribution Workflows**: Learn about common open-source workflows such as forking, pull requests, and code reviews.
3. **Project Analysis**: Choose an open-source project (such as Linux, React, or TensorFlow) and analyze its contribution guidelines, license, documentation, and community.
4. **Google Dorking**: Explore the Google Dorking technique and its ethical implications, using the TryHackMe Google Dorking room.
5. **Blog**: Write a blog summarizing the conventions, comparing open-source licenses, explaining how to contribute, and highlighting key takeaways.

## Key Takeaways

- **Licenses**: MIT and Apache licenses allow for more flexibility and broader use in projects, while GPL requires derivatives to be open-source as well.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Forking a project and making a pull request is a typical method of contributing to an open-source project.
- **Google Dorking**: While Google Dorking is a powerful technique for finding sensitive data, it is important to use it responsibly and ethically.

## Conclusion

This task provided valuable insights into open-source project conventions and the techniques involved in Google Dorking. By analyzing various open-source projects and understanding their licenses, contribution workflows, and community engagement practices, I am now better equipped to contribute to open-source initiatives while understanding ethical considerations in data security and privacy.
